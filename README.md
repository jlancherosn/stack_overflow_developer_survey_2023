# stack_overflow_developer_survey_2023

## Installations
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Motivation
This project have the proposed to explore the tools that programmers are using to write their programs in languages ​​such as Java and Python. What are the main type developers using that languages ​​and what are the variables most influence have on the salary. As Java and Python are popular languages ​​right now because of their versatility, it is interesting to know how the programmer community is using each one, both are giant and amazing worlds so maybe it will be interesting to see some insights and compare both whether you want to decide what approach to giving to your career.

## File Descriptions
There is a Python notebook where the above questions are developed, the data was taken from Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2023 site: https://survey.stackoverflow.co/

Data files used in the notebook are the ``.csv`` files ``survey_results_public`` which contains the results of the survey as arrows and 
the ``survey_results_schema`` with the metadata of the survey. Along with these, yo will find the ```README_2023.txt`` and ``so_survey_2023.pdf`` if you want more detail about data provided from Stack Overflow site.

## How to interact

To run the code you can download the .ipynb file and then open it as Jupyter notebook join with the data file in csv format.
All acknowledgement to Stack Overflow for the data, the data is free access on their site. You ae free of use the code of this repository as you want.
